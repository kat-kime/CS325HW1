# INSTRUCTIONS
- Clone the GitHub repository
- Open the folder that contains the files
- Make sure you have a data.txt file (I have my own sample data.txt file, so you may need to replace it)
- Run each program by entering python + the name of the program. It should read as the following:
  - python insert-program-name-here
  - (Depending on your system, you may need to replace "python" with "python3")
